##  COVID-19 {{ date }} report
Feel free to use these charts to raise awareness about the danger Covid-19 represents. 

### Spread comparison 
Coronavirus is spreading differently in different countries.

Spain is very concerning, it takes less than two days for death count to double. Faster than Italy.

UK is starting after other countries, so death count is smaller, but growth is even faster than Spain.

France is following quite accurately Italy.

United States and Germany death numbers are quite surprising.

For both countries, cases are growing as fast as other countries, but deaths are not.

Itâ€™s been said that Germany is not counting deaths with comorbidities like other countries, that could explain this.
Another explanation would be a very agressive testing of cases, like South Korea.
